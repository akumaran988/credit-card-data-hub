SMA & NPA

- Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’):

In furtherance to Regulatory requirements, SBI Card is required to identify incipient stress in the account by creating a sub-asset category viz. ‘Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’)” with the three sub-categories as given in the table below. Credit cards are treated as “Loans other than revolving facilities”.

|SMA Sub-categories|Basis for classification [Principal or interest payment or any other amount wholly or partly overdue]|
|---|---|
|SMA – 0|Upto 30 days from Payment Due Date (‘PDD’).|
|SMA – 1|More than 30 days & upto 60 days from PDD|
|SMA – 2|More than 60 days & upto 90 days from PDD|

Example regarding classification of SMA: If Payment Due Date (‘PDD’) of a Credit Card account is 31st March 2021, and ’Minimum Amount Due (‘MAD’) is not received before this date then after the due date, the account will be mentioned as SMA – 0. If the account continues to remain overdue beyond 30 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th April 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA-1. Similarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, beyond 60 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th May 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA – 2.

- Non-Performing Asset (‘NPA’):

A credit card account will be treated as non-performing asset (‘NPA’) if the Minimum Amount Due, as mentioned in the statement, is not paid fully within ninety (90) days from the PDD mentioned in the statement. Further, any account where a settlement or restructuring arrangement has been availed will be classified as NPA. An account continues to be classified as NPA till the entire arrears of interest and principal are paid. Settlement and restructured accounts do not qualify for anupgrade. Finally, if any customer has even one credit card with SBICard tagged as NPA, all cards of the customer will be classified as NPA.

Example regarding classification of an account as NPA:

If Payment Due Date (‘PDD’) of a Credit Card account is 31st March 2021, and Minimum Amount Due as mentioned in the statement has not been fully paid by the customer within a period of 90 days from the PDD i.e., till 29th June 2021, then the lender shall consider the credit card account as NPA.

# 6.10

Notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other clause of the Cardholder Agreement / Most Important Terms & Conditions (MITC), it is further stipulated that if the cardholder does not pay the minimum amount due for a period of 180 days, then the Credit Card services being provided by SBICPSL under this Agreement shall stand terminated, however the Cardholder shall continue to be liable for any unpaid sum as on the 180th day plus any finance charges / delayed payment interest that SBICPSL may, at its sole discretion and option and in accordance to its various internal policies and procedures, levy for the period post 180 days after the payment due date.

Considering the effective rate of 3.50% p.m., finance charge calculation will be done as follows:

|On the balance of Rs. 6000 (15th March to 22nd April) for 38 days:|(3.50*12)*(38/365)*6000/100= Rs. 262.36|

Considering the effective rate of 3.50% p.m., finance charge calculation will be done as follows On the balance of Rs. 500 (15th Dec to 22ndJan) for38 days: (3.50*12) * (38/365) *500/100 = Rs. 21.86

On the balance of Rs. 600 (20th Dec to 22nd Jan) for 33 days:

(3.50*12) * (33/365) *600/100 = Rs. 22.78
