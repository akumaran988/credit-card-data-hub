# 1. What is a Contactless Credit Card?

MILES SBI Card is powered by Mastercard Contactless technology. It is centered around providing frequent travelers with maximum benefits on their spends. This card is the one stop for all your travel needs in terms of spends, points redemption and lounge benefits.

# 2. How does the Contactless Credit Card work?

Step 1: Look for the Visa payWave/Contactless Indicator for RuPay & Mastercard mark and contactless logo at the point of sale.

Step 2: The cashier enters your purchase amount into the terminal. This amount will be displayed on the contactless reader.

Step 3: Hold your card over the reader or at the POS at close range (less than 4 cm from where the contactless logo appears).

Step 4: Four green indicator lights or a beep sound will indicate that the transaction is complete. A message will also be displayed on the screen indicating the transaction is complete. No PIN is required.

Please note that payment through contactless mode is allowed for a maximum of `5,000 for a single transaction.

# 3. What are the benefits?

Contactless payment functionality powered by Mastercard is specially designed for you for speed, convenience and security. During a contactless transaction the card never leaves your hand. This greatly reduces the risk of card loss and fraud through counterfeit/ skimming. A Mastercard contactless card has its own, unique, built-in, secret key, which is used to generate a unique code for every Visa contactless transaction, thus making it more secure. There’s no dipping, swiping or fumbling for cash. You’re ready to go in just a few seconds. Ideal for places like fast-food joints, petrol stations, movie theatre etc. You don’t need to look for cash/coins for small ticket everyday purchases. It is also easier to keep track of these expenses.

# 4. Is there a limit for a contactless transaction amount? Can I set my own Limit?

Payment through the contactless mode is allowed for a maximum of `5,000 for a single transaction. For a contactless transaction PIN is not required. This limit is common for all customers and setting up of individual limits is not possible. Any transaction amount more than `5,000 has to be carried out through a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) and entering the PIN. You can also choose to do a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) with PIN for transactions amount below `5,000.

# 5. Where can I use my Contactless Credit Card?

# 6. Can I use my Contactless Credit Card at other merchants (not enabled for contactless payment acceptance) as well?

Yes, for the merchants not enabled for contactless payment acceptance, you can use this card for a normal dip or swipe transaction.

# 7. Could I be debited twice if I have more than one contactless card?

No, contactless readers communicate with one card at a time. If the shop’s reader finds more than one contactless card in your wallet or purse, you will be asked to select one card to pay.

# 8. Could I unknowingly have made a purchase if I walk past the reader?

No, your card has to be waved within 4cm of the card reader for more than half a second and the retailer must enter the amount for you to approve. Terminals can only process one payment transaction at a time, therefore reducing transaction errors.

# 9. Is there any difference in the process for ATM and Internet transactions for this contactless Credit Card?

There is no difference in transaction process for ATM or any Card not Present Transactions including Internet transactions. For ATM transactions you need to enter the PIN and for Internet transaction you need to enter your 3D secure PIN or OTP.

# 10. What happens if my contactless card is stolen – can it be misused?

# USE CREDIT RESPONSIBLY

While you are empowered to use your credit card the way you wish to, it is best to use it responsibly. As credit card mismanagement is on the rise various financial institutions in the country have set up CIBIL, a body to monitor credit usage and safeguard the interests of member banks and financial institutions. Here is how an ideal credit cycle works:

# Auto Debit

Authorize SBI Card to debit your bank account (savings/current) by filling the Auto Debit mandate available at selected banks. For more details, visit www.sbicard.com

|You borrow credit|You get credit at better terms|You make your payments on time|
|---|---|---|

# WHAT IS CREDIT INFORMATION BUREAU INDIA LIMITED (CIBIL)?

CIBIL is India’s first credit information bureau established in 2004. It is a repository of information which contains the credit history of all borrowers. CIBIL’s members include all leading banks, financial institutions, non-banking financial companies, housing finance companies, state financial corporations and credit card companies.# WHAT IS A CREDIT INFORMATION REPORT?

A Credit Information Report (CIR) is a factual record of a borrower’s credit payment history compiled from information received from different credit grantors. Its purpose is to help Banks & Financial Institutions make informed lending decisions - quickly and objectively.

- Contact your creditors if you are having trouble making payments
- Make sure that your monthly account statement is correct
- Read the statements and other material you receive from your credit card company carefully
- Deal with companies you know and trust
- Pay attention to late payments, calls or letters from credit agencies, and denied or revoked credit. These are all signs that your credit history may be in jeopardy!

# HOW DOES THE CREDIT INFORMATION REPORT IMPACT ME?

When you approach the Banks & Financial Institutions for credit, your application will be evaluated on the basis of your past payment history, existing credit lines and other factors such as income and security. A good past payment history may lead to credit being granted faster and on better terms. On the other hand, a poor past payment record indicates past delinquency and can lead to denial of credit or extremely expensive credit. Therefore prudent credit management and financial discipline is a must to ensure a good credit history for enabling you for smooth and faster access to affordable credit in the future.

# HOW DO I IMPROVE MY CREDIT RECORD?

- Make at least the minimum amount due on time each month. On time payments will have the most positive significant impact on your credit record.
- Maintain affordable & reasonable levels of credit
- Limit the number of credit cards that you hold. Maintaining a large number of cards can hurt your credit history.
- Do not use your credit card such that your outstanding is very close to your credit limit as this can adversely affect your credit rating.

# HOW CAN YOU MAINTAIN A GOOD CREDIT HISTORY?

There are a number of things you can do to build and maintain a good credit history. Here are some important do’s and don’ts:

# DO’S

- Make your credit card payments on time
- Pay off your “Minimum Amount Due” on your card every month

However, the Cardholder should notify SBICPSL of this complaint. SBICPSL is not responsible or liable for any defect or deficiency in respect of goods and services charged to the Card. Any dispute should be settled directly by the Cardholder with the Merchant Establishment and failure to do so will not relieve the Cardholder of any obligations to SBICPSL.

Noncompliance with the regulations shall not be a ground for the Cardholder to delay or refuse the amounts payable to SBICPSL. In case the Card is suspended/cancelled, whether on account of non-compliance with exchange control/management regulations or otherwise, SBICPSL will not be responsible for any attempted usage of the Card, whether in India or abroad, resulting in the Card being dishonoured and the concerned Merchant Establishment would be entitled to pick up the Card on presentation.

6.9    SMA & NPA
       • Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’):
       In furtherance to Regulatory requirements, SBI Card is required to identify incipient stress in the account by creating a sub-asset category viz. ‘Special
       Mention Accounts (‘SMA’)” with the three sub-categories as given in the table below. Credit cards are treated as “Loans other than revolving facilities”.

        SMA Sub-categories           Basis for classification [Principal or interest payment or any other amount wholly or partly overdue]
        SMA – 0                      Upto 30 days from Payment Due Date (‘PDD’).
        SMA – 1                      More than 30 days & upto 60 days from PDD

        SMA – 2                      More than 60 days & upto 90 days from PDD
       Example regarding classification of SMA:
       If Payment Due Date (‘PDD’) of a Credit Card account is 31st March 2021, and ’Minimum Amount Due (‘MAD’) is not received before this date then
       after the due date, the account will be mentioned as SMA – 0.
       If the account continues to remain overdue beyond 30 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th April 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA-1.

       Similarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, beyond 60 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th May 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA-
       2.
       • Non-Performing Asset (‘NPA’):
       A credit card account will be treated as non-performing asset (‘NPA’) if the Minimum Amount Due, as mentioned in the statement, is not paid fully
       within ninety (90) days from the PDD mentioned in the statement. Further, any account where a settlement or restructuring arrangement has been
                                                                                                                                                              28availed will be classified as NPA. An account continues to be classified as NPA till the entire arrears of interest and principal are paid. Settlement and restructured accounts do not qualify for an upgrade. Finally, if any customer has even one credit card with SBICard tagged as NPA, all cards of the customer will be classified as NPA.

Example regarding classification of an account as NPA:

If Payment Due Date (‘PDD’) of a Credit Card account is 31st March 2021, and Minimum Amount Due as mentioned in the statement has not been fully paid by the customer within a period of 90 days from the PDD i.e., till 29th June 2021, then the lender shall consider the credit card account as NPA.

# Example 1 - Card Statement date – 15th of every month.

Transaction done between 16th June’19 – 15th July’19

1. Retail Purchase of Rs.5,000 – On 20th June’19
2. Cash Withdrawal of Rs.7,000 – On 10th July’19

Assuming No Previous Balance carried forward from the 15th June 2019 statement, the cardholder will get his 15th July statement showing Rs.12,000 of transactions along with 5 days of finance charges at the rate applicable on the Rs.7,000 cash withdrawal. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 5th August 2019, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due. Please note that any payment made against your credit card outstanding will first be cleared against GST, EMI amount, Fees/Charges, Finance charges, Retail Spends and Cash Advance in that order. Finance charges will be levied from the previous statement date unless in the case of non-interest levied outstanding retail balance, where the finance charge is levied from the date of the transaction.

In case the statement outstanding has no cash balance and has not been carried forward from a previous statement and the retail balance outstanding on the statement date is paid in full by the payment due date, No Finance Charges are levied on such balances.

# Example 2 – Card Statement date – 2nd of every month.

Transaction done between 3rd Jan’19 – 2nd Feb’19

1. Retail Purchase of Rs.10,000 – On 5th Jan’19
2. Online Purchase of Rs.30,000 – On 15th Jan’19

Assuming no previous balance carried forward from the 2nd Jan 2019 statement, the cardholder will get his 2nd Feb statement showing Rs.40,000 transactions. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd Feb 2019, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or the Minimum Amount Due. In case the statement outstanding has no cash balance and has not been carried forward from a previous statement and the retail balance outstanding on the statement date is paid in full by the payment due date, No Finance Charges are levied on such balances.

Making only the minimum payment every month would result in the repayment stretching over the years with consequent interest payment on your outstanding balance. For e.g. on a transaction of Rs.5,000 if Minimum Amount Due is paid every month (subject to a minimum amount of Rs.200 every month), it will take up to 44 months for entire outstanding amount to be paid in full.# Example 3 – Card Statement date – 2nd of every month.

Transaction done between 3rd March ‘19 – 2nd April ‘19

1. Annual fee of Rs.500 – On 5th March ‘19
2. Applicable taxes of Rs.90 – On 5th March ‘19
3. Online Purchase of Rs.6,000 – On 15th March ‘19

Assuming no previous balance carried forward from the 2nd March 2019 statement, the cardholder will get his 2nd April statement showing Rs.6,590 transactions. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd April 2019, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due.

Assuming the cardholder makes the payment of Minimum Amount Due of Rs.890, (5% of 6000 (retail spends)) + 90 (total GST) + 500 (100% of fee/charges) on 22nd April 2016, rounded off to nearest decimal point, finance charges would be levied at the effective rate and added to the total outstanding. Considering the effective rate of 3.50% p.m., finance charge calculation will be done as follows:

|On the balance of Rs.6,000 (15th March to 22nd April) for 38 days:|(3.50*12)*(38/365)*6000/100= Rs.262.36|
|---|---|
|On the balance of Rs.5,700 (22nd April to 2nd May) for 11 days:|(3.50*12)*(11/365)*5700/100= Rs.72.14|
|Total Interest charged|Rs.334.50|

Sum of Outstanding purchase amount, Interest charges, Fees and Charges, if any, and applicable taxes would reflect as the Total amount due in the statement dated 2nd May assuming the card holder does not make any transactions between 3rd April ‘19 – 2nd May ‘19.

If the Cardholder makes partial or no payment of Total amount due (TAD) before Payment due date (PDD); i.e. the Customer has outstanding balance from previous months and in the current month, full payment of Total amount due is made before Payment due date then Finance charges will be levied on retail spends, cash advance (if any) and finance charge (if any) till the payment date.

# Example 4: Card Statement date – 2nd of every month.

Transactions done between 3rd Dec’18 – 2nd Jan’19

1. Retail Purchase of Rs.500 – On 15th Dec’18
2. Online Purchase of Rs.600 – On 20th Dec’18

The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd Jan 2019, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due.

Assuming the cardholder makes partial payment of Rs.500, on 22nd Jan 2019, finance charges would be levied at the effective rate and added to the total outstanding. Considering the effective rate of 3.50% p.m., finance charge calculation will be done as follows:

|On the balance of Rs.500 (15th Dec to 22nd Jan) for 38 days:|(3.50*12) * (38/365) *500/100 = Rs.21.86|
|---|---|
|On the balance of Rs.600 (20th Dec to 22nd Jan) for 33 days:|(3.50*12) * (33/365) *600/100 = Rs.22.78|
|On the balance of Rs.600 (22nd Jan to 2nd Feb) for 12 days:|(3.50*12) * (12/365) *600/100 = Rs.8.28|
|Total Interest Charged|Rs.52.93|

Transactions done between 3rd Feb’19 – 2nd Mar’19

1. Beginning balance of Rs.652.93 – On 3rd Feb’19
2. Retail Purchase of Rs.1,000 – On 5th Feb’19
3. Online Purchase of Rs.3,000 – On 15th Feb’19

Assuming previous balance of Rs.652.93 carried forward from the 2nd Feb 2019 statement, theCardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd Feb 2019, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due. Assuming Cardholder makes complete payment by 15th Feb i.e. within Payment due date. Considering the effective rate of 3.50% p.m., finance charge calculation will be done as follows:

On the Balance of Rs.652.93 (3rd Feb – 15th Feb) for 12 days: (3.50*12) *(12/365) * 652.93/100 = Rs.9.02

Total Interest Charged = Rs.9.02

Sum of Outstanding purchase amount, Interest charges, Fees and Charges, if any, and all applicable taxes would reflect as the Total amount due in the statement dated 2nd March.

# G. Minimum Amount Due Definition

Minimum Amount Due shall be Total GST + EMI amount + 100% of Fees/Charges + 5% of [Finance charge (if any) + Retail Spends and Cash Advance (if any)] + Overlimit Amount (if any)

W.e.f 15th March 2024, In case 5% of (finance charge + retail spends and cash advance) is less than finance charges then MAD calculation will be Total GST + EMI amount + 100% of Fees/Charges + 100% of finance charges + Overlimit Amount (if any)

# Example:

Card Statement Date - 2nd of every month

Billing Statement period - 3rd Jan 2024 - 2nd Feb 2024

Total Retail Purchase balance - Rs.1,34,999.60

Finance Charge - Rs.11,972.18

Fee & Charges in the statement - Rs.2,700.00

Total GST in the statement - Rs.2,640.99

Assuming cardholder doesn’t make any spend transaction during the statement period, Minimum Amount Due (MAD) will be calculated as given below:

5% of (Finance Charge + Retail Spends + Cash Advance), i.e. 5% of (11,972.18 + 1,34,999.60 + 0) = Rs. 7,348.58

Since 5% of (Finance Charge + Retail Spends + Cash Advance) i.e. Rs 7,348.58 is less than Finance Charge of Rs.11,972.18, Minimum Amount Due will be calculated as Total GST + EMI amount + 100% of Fees/Charges + 100% of Finance Charges + Overlimit Amount (if any)

So, Minimum Amount Due (MAD) shall be, Total GST (Rs.2,640.99) + EMI amount (Rs.0) + 100% of Fees/Charges (Rs.2,700) + 100% of Finance Charges (Rs.11,972.18) + Overlimit Amount (Rs.0) = Rs.17,313.17

# H. Late Payment Charges

- NIL for Outstanding Amount on payment date from Rs.0-Rs.500
- Rs.400 for Outstanding Amount greater than Rs.500 & up to Rs.1,000
- Rs.750 for Outstanding Amount greater than Rs.1,000 & up to Rs.10,000
- Rs.950 for Outstanding Amount greater than Rs.10,000 & up to Rs.25,000
- Rs.1,100 for Outstanding Amount greater than Rs.25,000 & up to Rs.50,000
- Rs.1,300 for Outstanding Amount greater than Rs.50,000

An additional Late Payment Charge of Rs.100 will be levied on missing payment of Minimum Amount Due (MAD) by the due date for two consecutive cycles. This charge will continue to be levied for every payment cycle until the MAD is cleared.

k) SMA & NPA

- Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’): In furtherance to Regulatory requirements, SBI Card is required to identify incipient stress in the account by creating a sub-asset category viz. ‘Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’) with the three sub-categories as given in the table below. Credit cards are treated as “Loans other than revolving facilities”.# SMA Sub-categories

|SMA|Basis for classification [Principal or interest payment or any other amount wholly or partly overdue]|
|---|---|
|SMA – 0|Upto 30 days from Payment Due Date (‘PDD’).|
|SMA – 1|More than 30 days & upto 60 days from PDD|
|SMA – 2|More than 60 days & upto 90 days from PDD|

# Example regarding classification of an account as NPA:

If Payment Due Date (‘PDD’) of a Credit Card account is 31st March 2021, and Minimum Amount Due as mentioned in the statement has not been fully paid by the customer within a period of 90 days from the PDD i.e., till 29th June 2021, then the lender shall consider the credit card account as NPA.

# Example regarding classification of SMA:

If Payment Due Date (‘PDD’) of a Credit Card account is 31st March 2021, and Minimum Amount Due (‘MAD’) is not received before this date then after the due date, the account will be mentioned as SMA – 0. If the account continues to remain overdue beyond 30 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th April 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA-1. Similarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, beyond 60 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th May 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA – 2.

# Non-Performing Asset (‘NPA’):

A credit card account will be treated as non-performing asset (‘NPA’) if the Minimum Amount Due, as mentioned in the statement, is not paid fully within ninety (90) days from the PDD mentioned in the statement. Further, any account where a settlement or restructuring arrangement has been availed will be classified as NPA. An account continues to be classified as NPA till the entire arrears of interest and principal are paid. Settlement and restructured accounts do not qualify for an upgrade. Finally, if any customer has even one credit card with SBICard tagged as NPA, all cards of the customer will be classified as NPA.

# DEFAULT

In the event of default, the Cardholder will be sent reminders from time to time for settlement of any outstanding on the card account, by post, fax, telephone, e-mail, SMS and/or engage third parties to remind, follow up and collect dues. Any third party so appointed, shall adhere fully to the code of conduct on debt collection.

Before reporting default status of a credit card holder to a Credit Information Company which has obtained Certificate of Registration from RBI and of which the SBICPSL is a member, we will provide a prior communication to the card holder. In the event of non-payment of at least the Minimum Amount Due by the Payment Due Date, card account will be reported as ‘Default’ to credit information bureaus/agencies.

It may further be noted, that if a card holder, post being reported as defaulter, clears his/her dues, then SBICPSL would withdraw the defaulter status from the Credit Information Company.
