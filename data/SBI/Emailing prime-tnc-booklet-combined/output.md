# SBI Card PRIME CONTACTLESS FAQs

# 1. What is SBI Card PRIME Contactless Credit Card?

SBI Card PRIME Contactless Credit Card powered by Visa payWave/MasterCard Contactless is a fast and convenient way to pay for every day purchases. It is a secure, contactless chip technology designed to help you spend less time at the cash register and give you the freedom to do the things that matter most to you.

# 2. How does the SBI Card PRIME Contactless Credit Card work?

1. Look for the Visa payWave/MasterCard Contactless mark and contactless logo at the point of sale.
2. The cashier enters your purchase amount into the terminal. This amount will be displayed on the contactless reader.
3. Hold your card over the reader or at the POS at close range (less than 4 cm from where the contactless logo appears).
4. Four green indicator lights or a beep sound will indicate that the transaction is complete. A message will also be displayed on the screen indicating the transaction is complete. No PIN is required.

Please note that payment through contactless mode is allowed for a maximum of INR 5000 for a single transaction.

# 3. What are the benefits?

Contactless payment functionality powered by Visa payWave/MasterCard Contactless is specially designed for you for speed, convenience and security. There’s no dipping, swiping, entering PIN or fumbling for cash. You’re ready to go in just a few seconds. Ideal for places like fast-food joints, petrol stations, movie theatres etc.

During a contactless transaction the card never leaves your hand. This greatly reduces the risk of card loss and fraud through counterfeit/skimming. A Visa payWave/MasterCard Contactless card has its own, unique, built-in, secret key, which is used to generate a unique code for every Visa payWave/MasterCard Contactless transaction, thus making it more secure. You don’t need to look for cash/coins for small ticket everyday purchases. It is also easier to keep track of these expenses.

# 4. Is there a limit for a contactless transaction amount? Can I set my own Limit?

Payment through the contactless mode is allowed for a maximum of INR 5000 for a single transaction. For a contactless transaction PIN is not required. This limit is common for all customers and setting up of individual limits is not possible. Any transaction amount more than INR 5000 has to be carried out through a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) and entering the PIN. You can also choose to do a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) with PIN for transactions amount below INR 5000.

# 5. Where can I use my SBI Card PRIME Contactless Credit Card?

Yes, for the merchants not enabled for contactless payment acceptance, you can use this card for a normal dip or swipe transaction.

# 7. Could I be debited twice if I have more than one contactless card?

No, contactless readers communicate with one card at a time. If the shop’s reader finds more than one contactless card in your wallet or purse, you will be asked to select one card to pay.

# 8. Could I unknowingly have made a purchase if I walk past the reader?

No, your card has to be waved within 4cm of the card reader for more than half a second and the retailer must enter the amount for you to approve. Terminals can only process one payment transaction at a time, therefore reducing transaction errors.# PRIME T&C Booklet

|You get credit|at better terms|
|You make|your payments on time|

# What is Credit Information Bureau India Limited (CIBIL)?

CIBIL is India's first credit information bureau established in 2004. It is a repository of information which contains the credit history of all borrowers. CIBIL's members include all leading banks, financial institutions, non-banking financial companies, housing finance companies, state financial corporations and Credit Card companies.# PRIME T&C Booklet

# What is a Credit Information Report?

A Credit Information Report (CIR) is a factual record of a borrower's credit payment history compiled from information received from different credit grantors. Its purpose is to help Banks & Financial Institutions make informed lending decisions - quickly and objectively.

# How does the credit information report impact me?

When you approach Banks & Financial Institutions for credit, your application will be evaluated on the basis of your past payment history, existing credit lines and other factors such as income and security. A good past payment history may lead to credit being granted faster and on better terms. On the other hand, a poor past payment record or past delinquency may lead to denial of credit or extremely expensive credit. Therefore prudent credit management and financial discipline is a must to ensure a good credit history. This further enables you for smooth and faster access to affordable credit in future.

# How do I improve my credit record?

- Pay at least the minimum amount due on time each month. On time payments will have the most positive and significant impact on your credit record.
- Maintain affordable & reasonable levels of credit.
- Limit the number of Credit Cards that you hold. Maintaining a large number of cards can hurt your credit history.
- Do not use your Credit Card such that your outstanding is very close to your credit limit as this can adversely affect your credit rating.

# How can you maintain a good credit history?

There are a number of things you can do to build and maintain a good credit history. Here are some important do's and don'ts:

# Do’s

- Make your Credit Card payments on time.
- Pay off the “Minimum Amount Due” on your card every month.
- Contact your creditors if you are having trouble making payments.
- Make sure that your monthly account statement is correct.
- Read the statements and other material you receive from your Credit Card company carefully.

# Don’ts

- Don't spend over the specified credit limit on your Credit Card.
- Don't wait to report any unauthorized transactions on your account.
- Don't open new credit accounts for the purpose of debt consolidation without closing existing accounts.

# SMA & NPA

- Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’): In furtherance to Regulatory requirements, SBI Card is required to identify incipient stress in the account by creating a sub-asset category viz. ‘Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’)” with the three sub-categories as given in the table below. Credit cards are treated as “Loans other than revolving facilities”.

|SMA Sub-categories|Basis for classification [Principal or interest payment or any other amount wholly or partly overdue]|
|---|---|
|SMA – 0|Upto 30 days from Payment Due Date (‘PDD’).|
|SMA – 1|More than 30 days & upto 60 days from PDD|
|SMA – 2|More than 60 days & upto 90 days from PDD|

Example regarding classification of SMA: If Payment Due Date (‘PDD’) of a Credit Card account is 31st March 2021, and ’Minimum Amount Due (‘MAD’) is not received before this date then after the due date, the account will be mentioned as SMA – 0. If the account continues to remain overdue beyond 30 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th April 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA-1. Similarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, beyond 60 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th May 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA – 2.

- Non-Performing Asset (‘NPA’): A credit card account will be treated as non-performing asset (‘NPA’) if the Minimum Amount Due, as mentioned in the statement, is not paid fully within ninety (90) days from the PDD mentioned in the statement. Further, any account where a settlement or restructuring arrangement has been availed will be classified as NPA. An account continues to be classified as NPA till the entire arrears of interest and principal are paid. Settlement and restructured accounts do not qualify for an upgrade. Finally, if any customer has even one credit card with SBICard tagged as NPA, all cards of the customer will be classified as NPA.

Example regarding classification of an account as NPA: If Payment Due Date (‘PDD’) of a Credit Card account is 31st March 2021, and Minimum Amount Due as mentioned in the statement has not been fully paid by the customer within a period of 90 days from the PDD i.e., till 29th June 2021, then the lender shall consider the credit card account as NPA.

# 6.10

Notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other clause of the Cardholder Agreement / Most Important Terms & Conditions (MITC), it is further stipulated that if the cardholder does not pay the minimum amount due for a period of 180 days, then the Credit Card services being provided by SBICPSL under this Agreement shall stand terminated, however the Cardholder shall continue to be liable for any unpaid sum as on the 180th day plus any finance charges / delayed payment interest that SBICPSL may, at its sole discretion and option and in accordance to its various internal policies and procedures, levy for the period post 180 days after the payment due date.

Since the Minimum Amount Due has been paid, yet a balance of the previous month’s bill is outstanding, thus the ‘interest free credit period’ has been suspended. Considering the effective rate of 3.75% p.m., finance charge calculation will be done as follows:

On the balance of Rs.6,000 (15th March to 22nd April) for 38 days:

|On the balance of Rs.500 (15th Dec to 22nd Jan) for 38 days:|(3.75*12) * (38/365) *500/100 = Rs.23.42|
|---|---|
|On the balance of Rs.600 (20th Dec to 22nd Jan) for 33 days:|(3.75*12) * (33/365) *600/100 = Rs.24.41|
|On the balance of Rs 600(22nd Jan to 2nd Feb) for 12 days:|(3.75*12) * (12/365) *600/100 = Rs.8.88|
|Total Interest Charged:|Rs. 56.71|

Assuming Cardholder makes complete payment by 15th Feb i.e. within Payment due date. Considering the effective rate of 3.75% p.m., finance charge calculation will be done as follows:

|On the Balance of Rs. 656.71 (3rd Feb – 15th Feb) for 12 days:|(3.75*12) *(12/365) * 656.71/100 = Rs.9.72|
|---|---|
|Total Interest Charged:|Rs.9.72|

Sum of Outstanding purchase amount, Interest charges, Fees and Charges, if any, and all applicable taxes would reflect as the Total amount due in the statement dated 2nd March.

# G. Minimum Amount Due Definition

Minimum Amount Due shall be Total GST + EMI amount + 100% of Fees/Charges + 5% of [Finance charge (if any) + Retail Spends and Cash Advance (if any)] + Overlimit Amount (if any)

W.e.f 15th March 2024, In case 5% of (finance charge + retail spends and cash advance) is less than finance charges then MAD calculation will be Total GST + EMI amount + 100% of Fees/Charges + 100% of finance charges + Overlimit Amount (if any)

# Example:

Card Statement Date - 2nd of every month

Billing Statement period - 3rd Jan 2024 - 2nd Feb 2024

Total Retail Purchase balance - Rs.1,34,999.60

Finance Charge - Rs.11,972.18

Fee & Charges in the statement - Rs.2,700.00

Total GST in the statement - Rs.2,640.99

Assuming cardholder doesn’t make any spend transaction during the statement period, Minimum Amount Due (MAD) will be calculated as given below:

|5% of (Finance Charge + Retail Spends + Cash Advance), i.e. 5% of (11,972.18 + 1,34,999.60 + 0):|Rs. 7,348.58|
|---|---|
|Since 5% of (Finance Charge + Retail Spends + Cash Advance) i.e. Rs 7,348.58 is less than Finance Charge of Rs.11,972.18, Minimum Amount Due will be calculated as:|Total GST + EMI amount + 100% of Fees/Charges + 100% of Finance Charges + Overlimit Amount (Rs.0)|
|So, Minimum Amount Due (MAD) shall be:|Total GST (Rs.2,640.99) + EMI amount (Rs.0) + 100% of Fees/Charges (Rs.2,700) + 100% of Finance Charges (Rs.11,972.18) + Overlimit Amount (Rs.0) = Rs.17,313.17|# PRIME T&C Booklet

• Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’): In furtherance to Regulatory requirements, SBI Card is required to identify incipient stress in the account by creating a sub-asset category viz. ‘Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’) with the three sub-categories as given in the table below. Credit cards are treated as “Loans other than revolving facilities”.

|SMA – 1|More than 30 days & upto 60 days from PDD|
|SMA – 2|More than 60 days & upto 90 days from PDD|

Example regarding classification of SMA: If Payment Due Date (‘PDD’) of a Credit Card account is 31st March 2021, and Minimum Amount Due (‘MAD’) is not received before this date then after the due date, the account will be mentioned as SMA – 0. If the account continues to remain overdue beyond 30 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th April 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA-1. Similarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, beyond 60 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th May 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA – 2.# PRIME T&C Booklet

Further, any account where a settlement or restructuring arrangement has been availed will be classified as NPA. An account continues to be classified as NPA till the entire arrears of interest and principal are paid. Settlement and restructured accounts do not qualify for an upgrade.
