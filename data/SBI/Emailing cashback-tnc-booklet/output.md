# 1. What is CASHBACK SBI Card?

Ans: CASHBACK SBI Card powered by Visa contactless technology is a fast and convenient way to pay for every day purchases. It is a secure, contactless chip technology designed to help you spend less time at the cash register and give you the freedom to do the things that matter most to you.

# 2. How does the CASHBACK SBI Card work?

Ans: Step 1: Look for the Visa contactless technology mark and contactless logo at the point of sale.

Step 2: The cashier enters your purchase amount into the terminal. This amount will be displayed on the contactless reader.

Step 3: Hold your card over the reader at close range (less than 4 cm from where the contactless logo appears).

Step 4: Four green indicator lights or a beep sound will indicate when the transaction is complete. A message will also be displayed on the screen indicating the transaction is complete. No PIN is required.

Please note that payment through contactless mode is allowed for a maximum of `5000 for a single transaction.

# 3. What are the benefits?

Ans: Contactless payment functionality powered by Visa is specially designed for you for speed, convenience and security. During a contactless transaction the card never leaves your hand. This greatly reduces the risk of card loss and fraud through counterfeit/ skimming. A Visa contactless card has its own, unique, built-in, secret key, which is used to generate a unique code for every Visa contactless transaction, thus making it more secure. There’s no dipping, swiping or fumbling for cash. You’re ready to go in just a few seconds. Ideal for places like fast-food joints, petrol stations, movie theatre etc. You don’t need to look for cash/coins for small ticket everyday purchases. It is also easier to keep track of these expenses.# 4. Is there a limit for a contactless transaction amount? Can I set my own limit?

Ans: Payment through the contactless mode is allowed for a limit of maximum `5000 for a single transaction. For a contactless transaction PIN is not required. This limit is common for all customers and setting up of individual limit is not possible. Any transaction amount more than `5000 has to be carried out through Look, Wave, Go, a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) and entering the PIN. You can also choose to do a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) with PIN for transactions amount below `5000.

# 5. Where can I use my CASHBACK SBI Card?

Ans: You can look for the Universal Contactless symbol at the Point of Sale machine at merchant outlets. Also, please visit sbicard.com for details of merchants enabled for Visa contactless payment acceptance.

# 6. Can I use my CASHBACK SBI Card at other merchants (not enabled for contactless payment acceptance) as well?

Ans: Yes, for the merchants not enabled for contactless payment acceptance, you can use this card for a normal dip or swipe transaction.

# 7. Could I be debited twice if I have more than one contactless card?

Ans: No, as contactless readers will only communicate with one card at a time. If the shop’s reader finds more than one contactless card in your wallet or purse, you will be asked to select one card to pay.

# 8. Could I unknowingly have made a purchase if I walk past the reader?

Ans: No. Your card has to be waved within 4 cm of the card reader for more than half a second and the retailer must have first entered the amount for you to approve. Terminals can only process one payment transaction at a time, therefore reducing transaction errors.

# 9. Is there any difference in the process for ATM and Internet transactions for the CASHBACK SBI Card?

Ans: There is no difference in transaction process for ATM or any Card not present transactions including internet transactions. For ATM transactions you need to enter the PIN and for Internet transaction you need to enter your 3D secure PIN or OTP.# 10. How can I earn Cashback?

Ans: You can earn Cashback by making online and offline (Point of Sale) transactions using your CASHBACK SBI Card. For details, please see the cardholder T&Cs.

# 11. How much Cashback can I earn?

Ans: You can earn card cashback of 5% on online transactions and 1% on offline transactions. For exclusions and other details, please refer the cardholder Terms & Conditions document on sbicard.com.

# 12. Is there a limit to the Cashback that I can earn?

Ans: Maximum Card Cashback that can be earned on online and offline spends in a statement cycle will be capped at `5,000. Post reaching the capped limit of `5,000, spends with CASHBACK SBI Card for that statement month will not earn any CASHBACK.

For example: If your statement generation date is 11th July, the transactions posted from 12th June to 11th July will be considered under this statement cycle and all eligible online transactions during this period will accrue 5% Cashback and all eligible offline transactions will accrue 1% Cashback. The maximum card cashback that can be earned cumulative of online and offline spends is Rs. 5,000. Within the same statement period, all transactions posted after reaching the cashback limit of `5,000 will not accrue any cashback till 11th July.

Note: Card Cashback is accrued on posting/settlement date of transaction and not on effective date of transaction and accordingly Card Cashback will get accrued on account as per applicable cashback structure at the time of transaction posting.

# 13. My cashback for current statement shows negative balance. What does it mean?

Ans: Your Cashback will be reversed in case of purchase cancellations, reversals and returns. The reversal amount for such transactions will be adjusted/debited in your monthly statement.

For instance: An online transaction posted on 10th June of `1,00,000 would be eligible for a Card Cashback of 5% i.e. `5,000, assuming the statement was generated on 11th June. In that case, the Card Cashback of `5000 will be posted to your account on 13th June.

Suppose on 15th June, you returned the item. Then the cashback of `5000 will be reversed due to purchase return and the same will be adjusted/debited in your next monthly statement.# 14. What do I have to do to receive the earned Cashback?

Ans: The Card Cashback will be automatically credited to your SBI Card account and will reflect in your monthly statement.

|You need to borrow credit| | |

|You make your payments on time| | |
|Your credit score improves| | |

# WHAT IS CREDIT INFORMATION BUREAU INDIA LIMITED (CIBIL)?

CIBIL is India’s first credit information bureau established in 2004. It is a repository of information which contains the credit history of all borrowers. CIBIL’s members include all leading banks, financial institutions, non-banking financial companies, housing finance companies, state financial corporations and credit card companies.# WHAT IS A CREDIT INFORMATION REPORT?

A Credit Information Report (CIR) is a factual record of a borrower’s credit payment history compiled from information received from different credit grantors. Its purpose is to help Banks & Financial Institutions make informed lending decisions - quickly and objectively.

# HOW DOES THE CREDIT INFORMATION REPORT IMPACT ME?

When you approach the Banks & Financial Institutions for credit, your application will be evaluated on the basis of your past payment history, existing credit lines and other factors such as income and security. A good past payment history may lead to credit being granted faster and on better terms.

On the other hand, a poor past payment record indicate past delinquency and can lead to denial of credit or extremely expensive credit.

Therefore prudent credit management and financial discipline is a must to ensure a good credit history for enabling you for smooth and faster access to affordable credit in the future.

# HOW DO I IMPROVE MY CREDIT RECORD?

- Make at least the minimum amount due on time each month. On time payments will have the most positive significant impact on your credit record.
- Maintain affordable & reasonable levels of credit.
- Limit the number of credit cards that you hold. Maintaining a large number of cards can hurt your credit history.
- Do not use your credit card such that your outstanding is very close to your credit limit as this can adversely affect your credit rating.# 18

# HOW CAN YOU MAINTAIN A GOOD CREDIT HISTORY?

- Payments made using Standing Instructions / Fetch and Pay on SBI Card platforms (Website / Mobile App / Chatbot ILA)

- Flexipay Transactions

- Merchant EMI i.e. EMI’s availed at the time of purchase at Merchant establishment or websites. (Card Cashback reversed for Flexipay/Merchant EMI will be credited back to account only when the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any scenario)

- For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following break up of spends.

Online spends: ₹35,000 | Offline spends: ₹10,000

Of the said Online Spends, ₹10,000 was an EMI purchase. Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be ₹10,000 + ₹35,000 – ₹10,000 (EMI transaction) = ₹35,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be calculated as follows:

5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250

1% of ₹10,000 = ₹100

Thus, the total cashback for the example would be ₹1250+100 = ₹1,350

All identification of eligible and non-eligible transactions regarding Card Cashback by SBICPL are on best effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are subject to change basis network discretion.
