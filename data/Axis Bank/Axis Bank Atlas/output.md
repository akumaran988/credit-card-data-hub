# Tier Change:

Atlas credit cardholders’ tier will be evaluated at the beginning of each anniversary year on the basis of the previous year card spends.

# Eg-1: Tier upgrade on meeting spend threshold

Suppose a cardholder whose card issuance date is 1ˢᵗ Jan 2022, starts with Silver tier and spends INR 7 lacs up to 31ˢᵗ Dec 2022 (end of card anniversary year 1). On 1ˢᵗ Jan 2023 will continue to be in Silver tier until the cardholder spends 7.5 lacs to move to Gold tier.

However, if the cardholder had spent 9 lacs before 31ˢᵗ Dec 2022, cardholder will be upgraded to Gold Tier and will continue to maintain Gold tier for card anniversary year 2 (1ˢᵗ Jan 2023 – 31ˢᵗ Jan 2023).

# Eg-2: Tier Downgrade on not meeting spend threshold

Suppose a cardholder in card anniversary year 2 (1ˢᵗ Jan 2023 – 31ˢᵗ Dec 2023) is in gold tier, and spends a cumulative of 6 lacs only in the year. Since the Gold tier spend threshold of 7.5 lacs is not met, cardholder will be downgraded to silver tier in year 3 (1ˢᵗ Jan 2024- 31ˢᵗ Dec 2024).

However, if the cardholder had spent 9 lacs before 31ˢᵗ Dec 2023, cardholder will continue to remain in Gold Tier in year 3 (1ˢᵗ Jan 2024- 31ˢᵗ Dec 2024).# Benefits common across all tiers:
