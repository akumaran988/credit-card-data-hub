# Revision of FLIPKART AXIS BANK Credit Card Terms and Conditions

With effect from 20th April 2024, following revisions will be applicable on your FLIPKART AXIS BANK Credit Card:

1. # Revision of base cashback earned on eligible spends

Effective 20th April 2024, all transactions made using FLIPKART AXIS BANK Credit Card, other than the transactions made on Flipkart, preferred merchants, and cashback excluded categories, will earn a base cashback of 1%.
2. # Revision of Domestic Lounge program (Effective 1st May 2024)

The domestic airport lounge benefits on your FLIPKART AXIS BANK Credit Card will undergo the following changes.

Your lounge access benefits will be based on your FLIPKART AXIS BANK Credit Card spends in the previous 3 calendar months.

To access complimentary lounge from 1st May 2024 onwards, minimum spends required will be as follows:

|Credit Card|Min. spends (INR)|Min. spend period|
|---|---|---|
|FLIPKART AXIS BANK Credit Card|50,000|Previous 3 months|

In case of a newly issued card*, the minimum spend criteria is waived for the month of issuance followed by the next 3 months (as illustrated below).

For example, if card issuance date is 20th March 2024, you will be able to access lounge for the period 20th March to 30th June 2024, without any minimum spends. But if you want to avail lounge access after this period (in this case July 2024), then you will be able to do so only by spending INR 50,000 from 1st April to 30th June 2024 (preceding 3 months).

|Card Name|Card Issuance Date|Lounge Usage Period|Min Spends Required|Min Spends period|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|FLIPKART AXIS BANK Credit Card|20th March 2024|20th March to 30th June 2024|NA|NA|
| | |1st to 31st July 2024|INR 50,000|1st April to 30th June 2024|
| | |1st to 31st August 2024|INR 50,000|1st May to 31st July 2024|# AXIS BANK

*Upgrade to a different card product will not be considered as new card issuance. However, a card issuance, in addition to the card you hold, will be considered as new card issuance.
