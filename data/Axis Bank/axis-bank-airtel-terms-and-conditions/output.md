|Credit Card|Min. spends (INR)|Min. spend period|
|---|---|---|
|AIRTEL AXIS BANK Credit Card|50,000|Previous 3 calendar months|

In case of a newly issued card*, the minimum spend criteria is waived for the month of card issuance as well as for the following three months (as illustrated below).

For example, if card issuance date is 20ᵗʰ March 2024, you will be able to access lounge for the period 20ᵗʰ March to 30ᵗʰ June 2024, without any minimum spends. But if you want to avail lounge access after this period (in this case July 2024), then you will be able to do so only by spending INR 50,000 from 1ˢᵗ April to 30ᵗʰ June 2024 (preceding 3 months).# Card Name
