Non customer initiated payment/credit such as Merchant Refund/Cashback/Charge Reversals etc. received into the credit card account will not be considered as a payment towards the outstanding of the card. However, such credits will be considered to compute the subsequent month’s dues.

Cashback earned on purchases during the current billing cycle will be credited in customer’s account on T+3 days basis, from the statement generation date i.e. if the statement date is 12th March, cashback earned during the period between 12th Feb to 11ᵗʰ March will be credited by 15ᵗʰ of March.

Cashback earned will be computed based on spends during the statement period minus any returns or refunds during the same period.

In case the purchase/ transaction is returned/ cancelled/ reversed post statement generation date, cashback calculation will be calculated for the subsequent period taking the returned/reversed amount into consideration.

In case of conversion of a transaction to EMI at a later date in the same period, such transaction will not be eligible for a cashback.# Axis Bank

- For EMI transactions that are cancelled by the customer/bank, the cashback in the customer’s statement for that respective cycle might get debited twice, the customer would need to raise a service request by calling the Axis Bank customer care mentioning that cashback has been incorrectly debited with the date and amount of transaction for correction of the same.
