# 7. Interest- Free Period and Grace Period:# Credit Card Terms and Conditions

# a) Interest Free Period

The interest free period could range from 18 to 48 days and grace period will be given 3 days after the payment due date. For a credit cards account the statement for the period from April 15, 2023 to May 15, 2023 the payment due date would be June 2, 2023. Assuming that you have paid your Total Amount Due of the previous month statement by the payment due date, then interest free period would be:

1. For a purchase dated April 24, 2023, the interest free period is from April 24, 2023 to June 2, 2023, i.e. 40 days.
2. For a purchase dated May 14, 2023, the interest-free period is from May 14, 2023 to June 2, 2023, i.e. 20 days.

Thus, the interest free period can vary depending upon the date of purchase. Post the payment due date there will 3 days grace period given to customer and if the Total Amount Due is not paid by the payment due date + 3 days grace, then there will be no interest free period. For cash advances, interest is charged from the date of the transaction until the date of payment. If cardholder make the payment till Minimum Amount Due (MAD) by payment due date + 3 days grace period then there will not be any Late Payment Charges levied to customer however interest will be calculated from the transaction date.

# b) Withdrawal Limits

The Credit Limit and Cash Withdrawal Limit are communicated at the time of delivery of the Card and are indicated in the monthly statements. Available credit limit is calculated by deducting the utilized limit from the Total Credit Limit. In case the Card Member has availed of any loan within the credit limit on the card, the outstanding loan amount will also be deducted from the Total Credit Limit to arrive at the Available Credit limit.

Cash limit will be a sub-set of the credit limit and will be 10% of the credit limit up to a maximum of ₹20,000 for the first 180 days from the date of issuance of the Credit Card unless it is specified otherwise. After the expiry of the first 180 days from the date of issuance of the Card, ICICI Bank will make the cash limit available to the Cardholder at its sole discretion and on such terms as may be communicated by ICICI Bank from time to time.

In cases where multiple credit cards are mapped to one customer, total spends can be done only up to the combined aggregate credit limit calculated over all the credit cards cumulatively. It is clarified that the aggregate credit limit has been defined as the maximum limit across all the credit cards held by the customer. Any transactions done in excess of the aggregate credit limit shall be declined (except in cases where explicit consent is obtained for over-limit facility and subject to eligibility).

The Card Member shall be entitled for a review / enhancement / reduction of the credit limit and/or cash limit if provided by ICICI Bank. ICICI Bank shall at its sole discretion be entitled to review / alter (including enhancement or reduction) the credit limit and/or the cash limit assigned on the Card at any time and only enhancements, if any, to the credit limit and/or the cash limit, shall be effected by ICICI Bank along with consent of the Card Member.

The Minimum Amount Due shall be 5% of the outstanding amount or such other amount as may be determined by ICICI Bank at its sole discretion. In case of any repayment through installments, the installment amount due during the statement period will be added to the Minimum Amount Due. If the total outstanding is more than thecredit or cash limit, then the amount by which the credit or cash limit has been exceeded will also be included in the Minimum Amount Due. Any Fee charged in the statement over the credit limit will be considered twice in Minimum Amount Due calculation. Fees GST on customer’s statement post 26ᵗʰ Oct 2023 will also be included in the Minimum Amount Due. Minimum Amount Due shall also include unpaid Minimum Amount Due of the previous statements, if any.

# 1. Illustration of Minimum Amount Due Calculation:

The following illustration will indicate the method of calculating Minimum Amount Due:

In the table given below, it has been assumed that the Total Amount Due of the previous month statement has been paid by the payment due date and there is no outstanding amount. The statement date is 8th of every month. Given these assumptions, Minimum Amount Due will be calculated as below:

|Transaction|₹|
|---|---|
|Credit Limit|26,000.00|
|Purchase on Sep 20, 2023|24,000.00|
|Total Amount Due on statement dated Oct 08, 2023|24,000.00|
|Minimum Amount Due on statement dated Oct 08, 2023|1,200.00|
|Payment due date - Oct 26, 2023| |
|Purchase on Oct 15, 2023|2,000.00|
|EMI Conversion of Purchase on Oct 15, 2023|-2,000.00|
|EMI Principal|200.00|
|EMI Interest|20.00|
|Tax on EMI Interest|3.60|
|Processing Fee|20.00|
|Tax on processing Fee|3.60|
|Late Payment Fee on Oct 30, 2023|900.00|
|Tax on Late Payment Fee|162.00|
|Purchase on Oct 30, 2023|1,000.00|
|Over limit Fee|550.00|
|Tax on Over limit Fee|99.00|
|Closing Balance|26,958.20|

On statement dated Nov 08, 2023, following Minimum Amount Due is calculated:

- a) Overdue of previous statement: 1,200.00
- b) EMI Instalment (Principal s Interest): 220.00
- c) Amount above Credit Limit: 958.2
- d) Late Payment Fee - Post deployment: 900.00
- e) GST on Late Payment Fee - Post deployment: 162.00
- f) Over limit Fee Transaction - Post deployment: 550.00
- g) GST on Over limit Fee Transaction - Post deployment: 99.00
- h) 5% on remaining Balance: 1,143.45# I) Total Minimum Amount Due

5,232.65

If customer has registered for Auto Debit facility towards Credit Card repayment and has selected Minimum Amount Due option then the same will be executed on the due date provided no amount is paid by the customer before due date. If customer has paid an amount less than Minimum Amount Due before due date then differential amount would be debited. If customer has paid an amount, which is equal to, or more than Minimum Amount Due before due date then no additional amount will be debited from customer’s liability account.

If you spend ₹5,000 and pay back exactly the Minimum Amount Due (subject to a minimum payment of ₹100) every month, it will take you up to 6 years and 6 months to pay back the total amount. We therefore suggest that whenever your cash flows allow, pay back an amount substantially more than your Minimum Amount Due. Transactions converted to EMI / and promotional cashback will not be considered as a payment towards the outstanding of the card.

In case card member makes an excess payment compared to the outstanding of the card, there will be credit balance in the card account. This will be adjusted against the subsequent transactions on the card. However, no interest can be claimed on this excess credit amount.

# 2) Method of payment:

Payments towards the Card Account may be made in any of the following ways:

- Scan to Pay: Use Scan to Pay for making QR-Code based Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payments
